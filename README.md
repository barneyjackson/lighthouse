## SMS information service for refugee camps

Very few refugee camps have the resources or capacity to implement effective information dissemination services, word of mouth is the most common way for residents to get the latest camp information. This is particularly ineffective for women, people with disabilities and children or other marginalised groups who may have limited access to word of mouth due to social, cultural or personal reasons.

Lighthouse is a service that enables camps and organisations to create a simple SMS menu for people to access the information they need exactly when they. This reduces the load on camp staff and improves the lives of refugees.
